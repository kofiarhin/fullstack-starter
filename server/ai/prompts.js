Your task is to generate an Instagram carousel specification.
OUTPUT REQUIREMENT: Return ONLY a valid JSON object matching the schema below. No explanations, no markdown fences, no text outside the JSON.

INPUTS
- chosen_topic: e.g., Harmony, Contrast, Psychology, Branding, Symbolism, Warm vs Cool, Saturation/Value

GOAL
Produce:

GLOBAL COLOR RULES
- Use ONLY HEX codes from the generated palettes. No outside colors.
- Each palette = 2 colors (Primary + Accent) + 1 Text Overlay color for legibility.
- Include at least one light vs dark OR warm vs cool pairing across palettes.
- Avoid two mid-tones with no tension.

        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}

NAMING RULES
- Every color must have an evocative NAME and a valid HEX (#RRGGBB).
- Keep names culturally neutral unless Symbolism requires otherwise.

VALIDATION
- Ensure JSON is syntactically valid.
- Ensure "slides.palettes" is an array of EXACTLY 5 palette objects.
- Ensure textOverlay color has high contrast on both Primary and Accent (aim WCAG >= 4.5:1).

RESPONSE RULES
- Return ONLY the JSON object described above.
- Do not wrap in markdown fences (say "triple backticks" instead of using them).
- Do not include any prose outside the JSON.
- If unsure, output nothing but the JSON matching the schema.`;
